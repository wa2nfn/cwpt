<H2 <STRONG>cwpt2 - c.w. practice text (a Morse Code learning tool) </STRONG>
</H2>
<P>If you're learning Morse Code or working to increase your proficiency using a Morse tutor/trainer software program, then you may benefit from <B>cwpt2</B>'s features.
<BR>
<BR>This free tool does <U>NOT</U> replace the need for your Morse tutor software, it supplements their practice features. <B>Cwpt2</B> creates practice material in many formats that your current tutor software may not. Through its many options (over 45), you build practice sessions that support your learning needs.
</P>
<P><B>cwpt2</B> is a command line tool, its only 1 file so there is no complex install needed to try it
<P>
<PRE>
<B>Download it, give it execute permissions for you environment.</B>
<B>To run from the command line on Windows, hold the "windows" key and press "R", click "OK" on the pop-up window, cd to the directory where you placed the cwpt2.exe file,
execute with ".\cwpt2.exe etc."</B>

Update: Version 1.3.0 05/09/2020 
<P>A &quot;Whats New?&quot; see read-me file link below.
<P>It outputs text that can be played with any tutor (there are specific enhanced features for users of LCWO).
For learners, there is a tutor option that supports the learning order of a half dozen popular products.
<P>(Listen to the MP3s below for a simple demo of SOME features available for the LCWO tutor).

The following links are sample MP3 files. These were created by using &quot;cwpt2&quot; to generate output based on user chosen input text, and options determining word size, characters, etc., additionally &quot;ebook&quot; options were used to insert in-line code speed changes so when ebook2cw (free tool by author of LCWO.net) converts the text to cw to play as an MP3 you get more than fixed speed practice. 

*** NOTE: ebook2cw features are used in LCWO.net, these options, with speed changes can be read by  &quot;Convert text to CW&quot; screen for playback. *** 

These are just some SHORT examples to demo a few  features specifically for play by ebook2cw/LCWO. There many features that can be played in other trainers/tutors, these are explained in the read-me and NOT demonstrated  in the few MP3s.

i.e. |W2.5 |w20 more spacing between words
